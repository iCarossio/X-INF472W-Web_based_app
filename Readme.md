# Ã‰cole polytechnique | INF472W - Web based application

## The web app

With @bathal1, we chose to create a web application allowing anyone to publish stylized resume online.
The front-end is developed with AngularJS and the main interface is based on (IAMX)[https://trendytheme.net/items/i-am-x-html-resume-template/] template.
The back-end is made with PHP, according to the requirement of the course.
All the data are stored in a MySQL database.

A sample of the app can be tested in real conditions here: http://caross.io

> Today, the number of websites is close to one billion, whereas there were only 57,000,000 in 2004. In addition, these sites offer more and more personalized services according to the user: aggregators, workspaces shared, community sites or blogs are perfect examples. This new situation has seen the development of parallel technologies adapted for the development of such sites or should we currently say such applications.
>
> This course aims to approach from a practical point of view the problems related to the development of these applications. The techniques will be as follows:
> - Object programming in PHP.
> - Introduction to databases through MySQL.
> - Application security, maps and geolocation, javascript, Ajax ...
>
> This course will be mainly composed of TDs in the machine room, the students having to carry out in the long term a project like the development of a Web application allowing the dynamic management of a library (customers, stock, reservations, loans, returns, etc.). ), a small website hosting blogs, binet, a collaborative site or any other application of the same kind to choose ...
>
> The TDs will also be an opportunity to discover by practice some key concepts of contemporary computing, commonly used in the industrial world.
